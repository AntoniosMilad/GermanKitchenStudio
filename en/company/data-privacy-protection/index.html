							<h2 class="h1 headline">III. General information on data processing</h2>
							<p><strong>1. EXTENT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
							<p>As a rule we only collect and use the personal data of our users insofar as this is required for providing a functional website as well as our content and services. In general, our users' personal data is only collected and used with our users' consent. An exception applies in cases in which the factual situation makes it impossible to request consent before processing the data or processing the data is permitted by legal provisions.</p>
							<p><strong>2. LEGAL FOUNDATION FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
							<p>If we request the consent of the affected person for processing personal data, Art. 6 section 1 (a) of the EU data protection regulation (GDPR) serves as a legal foundation.</p>
							<p>If we process personal data for the purpose of executing a contract of which the affected person is a party, Art. 6 section 1 (b) GDPR serves as a legal foundation. This also applies to processing required for pre-contractual measures.</p>
							<p>If processing is required to maintain a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected person do not override the aforementioned interest, Art. 6 section 1 (f) GDPR serves as a legal foundation for processing.</p>
							<p><strong>3. DATA ERASURE AND STORAGE PERIOD</strong></p>
							<p>The personal data of the affected person is deleted or blocked, as soon as the purpose of storage is no longer valid. Beyond this point, storage is permissible, if European or national lawmakers have provided for this possibility in EU regulations, laws or other directives to which the responsible party is subject. The data is also blocked or deleted, when a mandatory retention period specified by the above-mentioned standards expires, unless further storage of the data is required for concluding or executing a contract.</p>
							<p><strong>4. SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></p>
							<p>As part of our online offer we have included links to the social networks Pinterest, Instagram and Houzz. You will recognise the links by the corresponding logo of each provider. By clicking on the link, the corresponding social media site will open, to which our data privacy statement does not apply. For details regarding the valid terms on these linked sites, please refer to the respective data privacy statements of the corresponding individual providers; these can be found at:</p>

							<h2 class="h1 headline">IV. Provision of the website and creation of log files</h2>
							<p><strong>1. DESCRIPTION AND EXTENT OF DATA PROCESSING</strong></p>
							<p>Any time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer. The following data is collected:</p>
							<p>(1) information about the browser type and version used,<br> (2) the user's operating system,<br> (3) the public IP address of the user,<br> (4) date and time of access,<br> (5) websites from which the user's system has accessed our website,<br> (6) transferred data volume and<br> (7) notification, whether the request was successful.</p>
							<p>This data is also saved in the log files of our system. This data is not saved together with other personal data of the user.</p>
							<p><strong>2. LEGAL FOUNDATION FOR DATA PROCESSING</strong></p>
							<p>The legal foundation for temporary storage of the data and the log files is Art. 6 section 1 (f) GDPR.</p>
							<p><strong>3. PURPOSE OF DATA PROCESSING</strong></p>
							<p>Temporary storage of the IP address by the system is required to permit provision of the website to the user's computer. For this purpose, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>
							<p>The data is stored in log files to ensure the function of the website. In addition, we use this data to optimise our website and safeguard the security of our information technology systems. The data is not evaluated for marketing purposes in this context.</p>
							<p>The above-mentioned purposes constitute our legitimate interest in processing this data according to Art. 6 section 1 (f) GDPR.</p>
							<p><strong>4. STORAGE PERIOD</strong></p>
							<p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. If data was collected to provide the website, this is the case as soon as the associated session is terminated.</p>
							<p>Moreover, we save the following access data in the log files:</p>
							<p>(1) the site from which you visit us or the name of the requested file,<br> (2) date and time of the request,<br> (3) the transferred data volume,<br> (4) notification, whether the request was successful,<br> (5) the public IP address of the requesting computer,<br> (6) referring URLs,<br> (7) type of browser used,<br> (8) operating systems used.</p>
							<p>This data is processed for the purpose of permitting use of our website (establishing a connection), for system security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and to optimise our web presence. Data is not disclosed to third parties nor is there any other utilisation. A personalised user profile is not created.</p>
							<p>If data is saved in log files, it is deleted after no more than 30 days. Further storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the user are deleted or made unidentifiable, so that it is no longer possible to associate them with the accessing client.</p>
							<p><strong>5. OPTION OF OBJECTION AND ERASURE</strong></p>
							<p>Collecting the data to provide the website and storing the data in log files is absolutely necessary for operating the website. This means that the user has no option to object.</p>

							<p>The legal foundation for processing personal data by using cookies for analysis purposes is Art. 6 section 1 (f) GDPR.</p>
							<p><strong>3. PURPOSE OF DATA PROCESSING</strong></p>
							<p>a) Technically necessary cookies<br> <br> The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to facilitate use of our website for the user. Some functions of our website cannot be provided without using cookies. For these functions it is required for the browser to be recognised even after changing sites. The following applications require cookies:</p>
							<p>(1) nobilia.de memo function<br> (2) kitchen online planner<br> (3) kitchen configurator<br> (4) digital showroom<br> (5) e-magazines</p>
							<p>The user data collected by technically required cookies is not used to create user profiles.<br> <br> b) Tracking cookies<br> <br> Tracking cookies are used to improve the quality of our website and its content. These cookies provide us with information on how our website is used, which allows us to continually improve our web presence.<br> <br> c) Marketing cookies<br> <br> Marketing cookies are used to show you customised content based on your interests.<br> <br> (1) Google Analytics</p>
							<p>We use Google Analytics for statistical evaluation. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94034, USA. Joint data processing in accordance with Art. 26 GDPR applies, with data processing primarily being performed by Google. The information generated by the cookies about your use of this website will generally be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. This means that both Google and government bodies in the USA have access to your personal data. Google may use the data for any purpose of its own, such as creating a profile and linking it to other available information.- However, within member states of the European Union or other states party to the European Economic Area Agreement, your IP address will first be abbreviated. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there. Google will use the generated information on our behalf in order to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website traffic, and to provide us with other services relating to the use of the website and the internet. You may refuse storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on the website or in your browser. Please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use the full range of functions on this website. You may also prevent Google from collecting and processing the data generated by the cookies relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) by clicking on the following link and downloading and installing the browser plug-in provided: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>
							<p>For further information on this matter, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/</a>&nbsp;(general information on Google Analytics and data privacy). Please note that "anonymizeIp();" was added to the Google Analytics code on our website to anonymise IP addresses by deleting the final 8-bit byte.</p>
							<p>If you wish to prevent use of the Google Analytics function, you can adapt any previously made settings at the bottom of the website under “Change data privacy settings”.<br> <br> (2) Google Tag Manager<br> <br> This website uses the Google Tag Manager. The Google Tag Manager is a solution which allows marketers to manage website tags through a user interface. The Tool Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-free domain and does not collect personal data. However, the tool triggers the use of other tags, which may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If the function was deactivated on the domain or cookie level, this deactivation applies to all tracking tags implemented through Google Tag Manager.<br> <br> For further information on the Google Tag Manager, visit: <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/tag-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/</a><br> <br> (3) Google Conversion<br> <br> We use the service offered by Google Ads Conversion in order to promote our attractive product range on external websites using advertisements (“Google Ads”). Based on the data of the promotional campaign, we can determine exactly how successful individual promotional measures are. Our interest in doing so is to show you ads that are relevant to your interests and to make our website more interesting to you.<br> <br> Google Conversion Tracking is an analytics service provided by Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”). Provided that your habitual place of residence is in the European Economic Area or in Switzerland, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) is the data controller responsible for your data. This means Google Ireland Limited is the Google-affiliated company responsible for processing your data and adhering to all applicable data privacy laws.<br> <br> These ads are delivered by Google via the “ad server”. For this purpose, we use ad server cookies, which permit analysis of specific parameters to determine success, such as frequency of ads being displayed and users clicking on ads. If you access our website by clicking on a Google ad, Google Ads will save a cookie on your device.<br> <br> These cookies allow Google to recognise your web browser. If a user visits specific pages on the website of an Ads client and the cookie saved on the user’s computer has not expired, Google and the client will be able to see that the user has clicked on the ad and was forwarded to this page. A different cookie is assigned to each Ads client. This means cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of Ads clients. Our company itself does not collect or process personal data through the above-mentioned promotional measures. We only receive statistical analyses provided by Google. These analyses show us which of the promotional measures we have used are particularly effective. We do not receive any other data through use of these promotional measures. Most importantly, we cannot identify users with this information.<br> <br> Google follows strict standards to protect this data - for instance, only those sites that contain the Google Conversion code are recorded. The recorded data is encrypted and only used on secure servers. For further information, refer to the Google data privacy policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</a><br> <br> (4) Google Remarketing<br> <br> We use the Remarketing function within the Google Ads service. The Remarketing function allows us to show users of our website ads based on their interests on other websites of the Google advertising network (“Google Ads” in Google searches or on YouTube or other websites).<br> <br> For this purpose, the user’s interaction with our website is analysed, e.g. which offers did the user show interest in, in order to show users targeted ads on other sites even after they have visited our website. To enable this function, Google saves a number in the browser of users who have visited specific Google services or websites in the Google display network. This number, referred to as a “cookie”, records the visits by this user. The number serves for unambiguous identification of a web browser on a specific device, not for identification of a person, as personal data is not saved.<br> <br> For further information, refer to the Google data privacy policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</a><br> <br> (5) Facebook Pixel<br> <br> This website uses the remarketing function “Custom Audiences” provided by Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”). This function makes it possible to show users of our website interest-based ads (“Facebook ads”) when they visit the social network Facebook or any other websites using this function. Our interest in using this function is to show you ads that are relevant to your interests in order to make our website more interesting to you.<br> <br> Your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Facebook server based on the use of this marketing tool. We do not influence the extent and further use of data collected by Facebook through use of this tool and will therefore provide information based on our own level of knowledge: Integration of Facebook Custom Audiences allows Facebook to see that you have accessed the respective page on our website or have clicked one of our ads. If you are registered with a Facebook service, Facebook can associate this visit with your account. Even if you are not registered with Facebook or are not logged in, it is possible for the provider to find out and save your IP address and other identifying features.<br> <br> Logged-in users can deactivate the “Facebook Custom Audiences” function under <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen</a>.<br> <br> For further information regarding data processing by Facebook, visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy</a>.<br> <br> (6) Pinterest Conversion Tracking<br> <br> Our website uses the Conversion Tracking technology of the social network Pinterest (Pinterest Europe Ltd., Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland), which allows us to show relevant ads and offers on Pinterest to users of our website who showed interest in our content/offers and are also Pinterest users. For this purpose, our websites contain a “conversion tracking pixel” of Pinterest, which lets Pinterest know that you have visited our website and which products in our product range you showed interest in. You can deactivate data collection for the purpose of targeted advertising on Pinterest at any point in your account settings on Pinterest under <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/settings" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://www.pinterest.com/settings</a>.<br> <br> For further information on the Pinterest Conversion Tracking technology, visit <a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/track-conversions-with-pinterest-tag" target="_blank" class="linkinline" rel="noreferrer">https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/track-conversions-with-pinterest-tag</a>.</p>

If you access a website into which Outbrain is integrated, Outbrain creates a pseudonym user profile (user ID) in which the content that you have viewed or read is saved. Our website or other websites into which Outbrain is integrated can then recommend further content that corresponds to your interests or display ads.

Consent can be revoked at any time.

Our concern within the meaning of the GDPR (legitimate interest) is the optimisation of our online offering and our web presence.

							<h2 class="h1 headline">VIII. Rights of the affected person</h2>
							<p>If personal data related to your person is processed, you are the affected person as defined by GDPR and you have the following rights toward the responsible party:</p>
							<p><strong>1. RIGHT OF ACCESS</strong></p>
							<p>You can request a confirmation by the responsible party indicating whether we are processing personal data related to your person.</p>
							<p>If this is the case, you can demand information on the following:</p>
							<p>(1) the purposes for which your personal data is processed;</p>
							<p>(2) the categories of personal data processed;</p>
							<p>(3) the recipients or categories of recipients to which the personal data was disclosed or will still be disclosed;</p>
							<p>(4) the planned duration of storage of your personal data or, if specific information cannot be given, criteria for determining the duration of storage;</p>
							<p>(5) the existence of a right to correction or deletion of your personal data, a right to limitation of processing by the responsible party or a right to object against this processing;</p>
							<p>(6) the existence of a right to submit a complaint to a supervisory authority;</p>
							<p>(7) all available information about the origin of the data, if the personal data is not collected from the affected person;</p>
							<p>(8) the existence of automated decision making including profiling in accordance with Art. 22 section 1 and 4 GDPR and - at least in these cases - meaningful information about the logic involved and the extent and envisaged effect of such a manner of processing on the affected person.</p>
							<p>You have the right to request information from us on whether the relevant personal data is transmitted to a third country or to an international organisation. In this context, you can demand to be informed about appropriate safeguards in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR in the context of this transmission.</p>
							<p><strong>2. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</strong></p>
							<p>You have the right to demand that the responsible party rectify and/or complete any personal data related to your person, if this data is incorrect or incomplete. The responsible party must make the correction as soon as possible.</p>
							<p><strong>3. RIGHT TO RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING</strong></p>
							<p>Under the following circumstances, you can demand that processing of your personal data be restricted:</p>
							<p>(1) If you dispute the correctness of your personal data, namely for a period of time which makes it possible for the responsible party to check that your personal data is correct;</p>
							<p>(2) If processing is illegitimate and you do not wish for your personal data to be deleted and instead request restriction of the use of your personal data;</p>
							<p>(3) If the responsible party no longer requires your personal data for processing purposes, but you still require the data for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims</p>
							<p>(4) If you have filed an objection based on Art. 21 section 1 GDPR and it is not yet clear whether the responsible party's legitimate interests override yours.</p>
							<p>If processing of your personal data was restricted, your personal data may only - with the exception of storage - be used with your consent or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural person or legal entity or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
							<p>If processing was restricted according to the above-mentioned prerequisites, the responsible party will inform you before this restriction is lifted.</p>
							<p><strong>4. RIGHT TO ERASURE</strong></p>
							<p>a) Erasure obligation</p>
							<p>You have the right to have personal data referring to your person deleted immediately and the responsible party is obligated to delete this data immediately, if one of the following reasons applies:</p>
							<p>(1) The personal data referring to your person is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.</p>
							<p>(2) You withdraw your consent on which processing was based in accordance with Art. 6 section 1 (a) or Art. 9 section 2 (a) GDPR and there is no other legal foundation for processing.</p>
							<p>(3) Based on Art. 21 section 1 GDPR, you object to the processing of your data and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for processing, or you object to the processing based on Art. 21 section 2 GDPR.</p>
							<p>(4) The personal data related to your person was processed illegitimately.</p>
							<p>(5) Erasure of your personal data is required to meet a legal obligation according to European Union law or the law of EU member states, to which the responsible party is subject.</p>
							<p>(6) The personal data related to you was collected based on offered information society services according to Art. 8 section 1 GDPR.</p>
							<p>b) Transmission to third parties</p>
							<p>If the responsible party has published the personal data related to your person and is obligated to delete it according to Art. 17 section 1 GDPR, the responsible party will take adequate measures, including of a technical nature, taking into account the available technology and its implementation cost, to inform those responsible for data processing, who are processing the personal data in question, that you as the data subject have demanded that they delete all links to this personal data or copies and duplicates of this personal data.</p>
							<p>c) Exceptions</p>
							<p>There is no right to erasure, if processing is required</p>
							<p>(1) for exercising the right to free speech and information;</p>
							<p>(2) to meet a legal obligation which requires processing according to European Union law or the law of one of its member states, to which the responsible party is subject, or to fulfil a task that is in the public interest or a task of official authority assigned to the responsible party;</p>
							<p>(3) for reasons of public interest with regard to public health according to Art. Art. 9 section 2 (h) and (i) as well as Art. 9 section 3 GDPR;</p>
							<p>(4) for archival purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with Art. 89 section 1 GDPR, provided that the right to erasure is expected to make achieving these aims of processing impossible or to severely impact them, or</p>
							<p>(5) to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
							<p><strong>5. RIGHT TO INFORMATION</strong></p>
							<p>If you have exercised your right to correction, erasure or restriction of processing against the responsible party, the responsible party is obligated to report this correction or erasure of data or processing restriction to all recipients to whom your relevant personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves to be impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</p>
							<p>You have the right to request that the responsible party inform you about these recipients.</p>
							<p><strong>6. RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong></p>
							<p>You have the right to object to processing of personal data related to your person at any time for reasons based on your specific situation, if this processing is based on Art. 6 section 1 (e) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>
							<p>The responsible party will not continue to process the personal data related to your person, unless the responsible party can prove interests worthy of protection for this processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or if processing is for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.</p>
							<p>If the personal data related to your person is being processed for the purpose of targeted advertisement, you have the right to object to the processing of the personal data related to your person for the purpose of this type of advertising at any point; this also applies to profiling related to such targeted advertisement.</p>
							<p>If you object to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of targeted advertising, your personal data will no longer be processed for this purpose.</p>
							<p>You have the option of exercising your right to object in the context of use of information society services - irrespective of directive 2002/58/EC - by means of automated processes using technical specifications.</p>
							<p><strong>7. RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THE DECLARATION OF CONSENT UNDER DATA PROTECTION LAW</strong></p>
							<p>You may withdraw your declaration of consent under data protection law at any point. Withdrawal of your consent does not affect the legitimacy of the data processing performed up to that point based on your consent.</p>
							<p><strong>8. RIGHT TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH A SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
							<p>Without prejudice to other legal remedies based on administrative law or court decisions, you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority, especially in the member state that is your location, the location of your workplace or the location of the alleged breach, if you believe that processing of your personal data violates GDPR.</p>
							<p>The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been filed informs the complainant about the status and result of the complaint including the option of legal remedy according to Art. 78 GDPR.</p>
							<p>The responsible supervisory authority is:</p>
