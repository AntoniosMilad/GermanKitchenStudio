													<p>From a data protection perspective, it is necessary to assume that we and Meta have separate responsibilities for the operation of the page on Instagram and the associated communication and evaluation options. Insofar as your personal data is processed by us in connection with your visit to our Instagram page and we alone decide on the purposes and means of this data processing, we are responsible for this data processing. This is usually the case when you communicate with us directly using the âInstagram Direct Messagingâ function and send us your data in the process. Insofar as your personal data is processed by Meta and Meta alone decides on the purposes and means of the data processing, Meta is solely responsible for this data processing.

Our legitimate interest lies in the recording and processing of customer enquiries, in the evaluation of customer enquiries and in the control of misuse.</p>
													<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. For your personal data, this is the case when the respective conversation has ended. For us, the conversation is ended when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the matter in question has been conclusively clarified. You have the option at any time to revoke your consent to the processing of personal data; in this case, we will delete the data immediately if there is no basis for further storage.</p>
